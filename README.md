# Detect Face Mask (CNN, Convolutional neural network)

In deep learning, using a convolutional neural network (CNN) we are trying to detect face have MASK or no

## COVID-19 face mask detection dataset



> A face mask detection dataset consists of “with mask” and “without mask” images. We will use the dataset to build a COVID-19 face mask detector with computer vision and deep learning using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras.

## Using

```
$ python preprocessing.py
$ python train.py
$ python demo.py
```

### Figure loss and accuracy

I am not owner of most of things and I just used a dataset which avaiable on the following links. It was so funny for me to implenment and test and running this idea (Detect Masky face) in my machine.
